        <h3 id="headline">A time line of Jr Martin Luther King's life:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1929:</strong>Born  in Atlanta, Georgia</li>
            <li><strong> 1944:</strong>King entered Morehouse College in Atlanta under a 
                special wartime program intended to boost enrollment by admitting promising 
                high-school students like King. </li>
            <li><strong>1948:</strong>He graduated from Morehouse.
                King spent the next three years at Crozer Theological Seminary in Chester, Pennsylvania, 
                where he became acquainted with Mohandas Gandhi’s philosophy of nonviolence as well 
                as with the thought of contemporary Protestant theologians. </li>
            <li><strong>1951:</strong>He earned a bachelor of divinity degree.
                Renowned for his oratorical skills, King was elected president of Crozer’s student body, 
                which was composed almost exclusively of white students</li>
            <li><strong>1953:</strong>He married and had four children with his wife  Coretta Scott
                 </li>
            <li><strong>1955:</strong>From Crozer, King went to Boston University, where, in seeking a firm foundation for 
                his own theological and ethical inclinations, he studied man’s relationship to God and received a doctorate 
                for a dissertation titled 
                “A Comparison of the Conceptions of God in the Thinking of Paul Tillich and Henry Nelson Wieman.” 
                King had been pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, slightly more than 
                a year when the city’s small group of civil rights advocates decided to contest racial segregation on 
                that city’s public bus system following the incident on December 1, 1955.</li>
            <li><strong>1959:</strong>He and his party were warmly received by India’s Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru 
                and others; as the result of a brief discussion with followers of Gandhi about the Gandhian concepts of 
                peaceful noncompliance (satyagraha), King became increasingly convinced that nonviolent resistance was the 
                most potent weapon available to oppressed people in their struggle for freedom.</li>
            <li><strong>1963:</strong>King’s campaign to end segregation at lunch counters and in hiring practices drew 
                nationwide attention when police turned dogs and fire hoses on the demonstrators. </li>
            <li><strong>1964:</strong>He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
            <li><strong>1960 to 1965:</strong>King’s influence reached its zenith. Handsome, eloquent, 
                and doggedly determined, King quickly caught the attention of the news media, particularly 
                of the producers of that budding medium of social change</li>
            <li><strong>1967:</strong>In the face of mounting criticism, King broadened his approach to include concerns other than racism. </li>
            <li><strong>1968:</strong>Dies at the age of 39.</li>
        </ul>
